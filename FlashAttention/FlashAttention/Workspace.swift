// TODO:
// - Fire up the new square attention test, using the default parameters.
// - Run a benchmark over head dimension.
// - Run the same benchmark, but with the parameters.
// - Check for a performance improvement from the parameters.
// - Check for a performance improvement in the remaining ones.
// - Tweak parameters that give the wrong performance.
