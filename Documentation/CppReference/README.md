# C++ Reference Implementation of GEMM

This is an archived C++ translation of [UnifiedGEMMKernel.swift](https://gist.github.com/philipturner/84f613a5cc745460a914d2c6ad226131). It separates the code into multiple files, as done in-tree in `metal-flash-attention`.

The code is self-contained. One can create a new Xcode project for C++, copy the files, and it should compile.
